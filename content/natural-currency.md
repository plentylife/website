Many people have an impression that CEOs of multinational corporations are inherently *"evil"*. That's not the truth.

CEOs are simply playing by the rules, laws, regulations and fundamentally mechanical properties of money. It's a 
large scale game of Monopoly. You don't think your friends are evil, when you play Monopoly and they ask you for 
rent? No, they're just playing by the rules.

Money is absolutely *fundamental to civilization*, but it is also totally *malleable* --- after all it is an abstract 
concept, born of human mind. It's not a law of nature. We can change how money works.

*Natural currencies* are the answer to preventing human race from self-destructing. The technical term is demurrage, 
and it simply means that the longer you hold money, the less you have --- negative interest. It the same as going 
grocery shopping; you buy what you need, and not for 3 months ahead, because food spoils.

We aren't inventing this concept. The ancient Egyptians used this system of money with clay tablets --- this is 
ancient stuff, well forgotten! A modern example, is a little town of WÃ¶rgl in Austria, that was [booming during the 
Great Depression][1]. Wait, what, **booming during the Great Depression**? Yes, in desperation they introduced a local 
natural currency, and a little town of 4000 people built a reservoir, a ski jump, and a bridge. The national bank 
shut the experiment down.

Negative interest rate is nothing to be afraid of. Remember, your savings are already being drained by inflation. The
 difference is in the math, and how it [affects financial calculations][2] --- precisely the thing that *"Big Evil 
 Corporations"* do. By changing the mechanics of money --- flipping the rules of the game --- we make it profitable to keep the 
 Amazon alive, we transform "the root of all evil" into the root of all good.
 
That is why we created a crypto-currency based on these principles. It's a one of a kind in the crypto-currency 
world, because **you can't buy it**. We're not interested in making a bunch of dollars from a token sale like the rest
. We're envisioning a world beyond the dollar, and will do anything in our power to manifest it.
