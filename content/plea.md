*We are actively looking for funding.*

Our vision is a drastically different world. We see a peaceful, green and blue planet, but we are afraid that without
 adopting a sane form of money, globally, humans will turn it into an uninhabitable dust ball.
 
 To us it is more important than ever to transform our vision into a tangible reality; **we have a little human on the
  way to being born**. 
 
 We are working harder than ever. All we need to continue the good fight is a bit of support, just some food on 
 our table and a roof over our heads.
 
 Please, please, if you would like to *donate*, or know of anyone who would *fund* Plenty, send us a message!
