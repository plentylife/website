We aren’t into changing the world. That’s too big a task, we’re too small a group.
We work smart. We are *nudging* the world, and this will bring changes larger than we could have ever imagined.

Our goal is to solve major global issues that threaten humanity. We believe that these persist because there are very
 few strong communities left in the world, leaving too many caught in the [*rat race*][1], unable to act or even care 
 about issues around them, let alone global issues.
 
 We are creating an [app][2] and a [crypto-currency][3] that work symbiotically together. The beauty of this project is 
 that you, as the end user, don't need to think on a global scale. **You simply need to do what you love with the people 
 you love**. When people come together, support each other, create together, rather than exist in constant state of 
 anxiety and competition, issues such as poverty, hunger, pollution and deforestation disappear.
