Hacking money to feed kids

We aren’t into changing the world. That’s too big a task, we’re too small a group.
We work smart. We are *nudging* the world, and this will bring changes larger than we could have ever imagined.

We’ve been thinking about this a very long time. It’s doable. The recipe is actually simple.
It has been done before. It worked.

Take a pause here. Let us ask you a question: just how many global issues bother you? How many of them are based in some real, physical limitation?

We can think of a very long list, to name a couple:

- Starving kids, even in “1st” world countries (the world produces more than enough food to feed everybody) and abject poverty (how is that still a thing?)
- Cutting down the Amazon (we’ll all suffocate) and overfishing to the point of complete depletion (when we can have fish indefinitely, if harvested sustainably) 

We call these issues moronic, because unlike death and disease, there’s nothing stopping the human race from raising 
above.
