*For the curious*

*In a nutshell, the following is the problem with the dollar. To understand it, you need some 
proficiency with mathematics and finance.*

What if I gave you $10 every year for *Infinity*? How many dollars would you eventually have? Duh --- *Infinite* amount.

Feel rich yet? Let us burst your bubble.  
What is your *Infinity* of dollars worth? Just a mere $510.

How? *Inflation*.

The above is a geometric series sum, adding $10 from 0 until *Infinity* at 2% inflation rate (the current rate in 
Canada and US). Which is the same as: $10 + $9.80 + ... + $8.20 + ... + 0.01 + ...

Is this not insane to you? How can an *Infinite* amount of dollars equal a meager $510?   
How do you expect a corporation to preserve the Amazon? Yes, the Amazon is of *Infinite* worth, but because of inflation, financially it's not.

Natural currencies flip the equation. They make future money worth more than present day money.
They make it profitable to keep the Amazon alive.
