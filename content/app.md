There's another thing that makes us a unique project. We are building a *self-governance* and *self-organization* 
application on top of our currency, which immediately makes it useful!

Can you think of a better match: a crypto-currency meant to build *strong local communities*, with a tool making it 
possible for *large groups of people to organize* into an efficient government?

The app is meant for organizing a group of people at any level, from a book club to a country; the one key ingredient
 is that you have to meet on regular basis.
 
 We have prepared a little audio tutorial for you to enjoy.
