                <h2>We are all wealthy</h2>
                <p>We aren’t into changing the world. That’s too big a task, we’re too small a group.
                  We work smart. We are <em>nudging</em> the world, and this will bring changes larger than we could have ever imagined.</p>

                <p>Our goal is to solve major global issues that threaten humanity. We believe that these persist because there are very
                  few strong communities left in the world, leaving too many caught in the <a
                      href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/rat--race" target="_blank"><em>rat race</em></a>, unable to act or
                  even care
                  about issues around them, let alone global issues.</p>

                <p> We are creating a <a href="#third">chat app</a> and a <a href="#currency">crypto-currency called ₸hanks</a> that work
                  symbiotically together. The beauty of this project is
                  that <em>you</em> don&rsquo;t need to think on a global scale. <strong>You simply need to do what you love with the people
                    you love</strong>. When people come together, support each other, create together, rather than exist in constant state of
                  anxiety and competition, issues such as poverty, hunger, pollution and deforestation disappear.</p>

              <div id="currency" data-magellan-target="currency">
                <h2>₸hanks as crypto-currency</h2>
                <p>Many people have an impression that CEOs of multinational corporations are inherently <em>&ldquo;evil&rdquo;</em>. That&rsquo;s not the truth.</p>

                <p>CEOs are simply playing by the rules, laws, regulations and fundamentally mechanical properties of money. It&rsquo;s a
                  large scale game of Monopoly. You don&rsquo;t think your friends are evil, when you play Monopoly and they ask you for
                  rent? No, they&rsquo;re just playing by the rules.</p>

                <p>Money is absolutely <em>fundamental to civilization</em>, but it is also totally <em>malleable</em> &mdash; after all it is an abstract
                  concept, born of human mind. It&rsquo;s not a law of nature. We can change how money works.</p>

                <p><em>Natural currencies</em> are the answer to preventing human race from self-destructing. It simply means that the longer you
                  hold money, the less you have &mdash; negative interest. It&rsquo;s the same as going
                  grocery shopping; you buy what you need, and not for 3 months ahead, because food spoils.</p>

                <p>We aren&rsquo;t inventing this concept. The ancient Egyptians used this system of money with clay tablets &mdash; this is
                  ancient stuff, well forgotten! A modern example, is a
                  <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%C3%B6rgl#The_W%C3%B6rgl_Experiment">little town of Wörgl in Austria that was
                  booming during the Great Depression</a>. Wait, what, <strong>booming during the Great Depression</strong>? Yes, in desperation they introduced a local
                  natural currency, and a little town of 4000 people built a reservoir, a ski jump, and a bridge. The national bank
                  shut the experiment down.</p>

                <p>Negative interest rate is nothing to be afraid of. Remember, your savings are already being drained by inflation. The
                  difference is in the math, and how it <a href="#for-curious">affects financial calculations</a> &mdash; precisely the thing that <em>&ldquo;Big Evil
                    Corporations&rdquo;</em> do. By changing the mechanics of money &mdash; flipping the rules of the game &mdash; we make it profitable to keep the
                  Amazon alive, we transform &ldquo;the root of all evil&rdquo; into the root of all good.</p>

                <p>That is why we created a crypto-currency based on these principles. It&rsquo;s a one of a kind in the crypto-currency
                  world, because <strong>you can&rsquo;t buy it</strong>, you can't buy <em>₸hanks</em>. We&rsquo;re not interested in making a bunch of dollars from a token sale like the rest
                  . We&rsquo;re envisioning a world beyond the dollar, and will do anything in our power to manifest it.</p>

                <p><a href="#currency">Natural money</a> is nothing short of a miracle. And to bring this miracle into our everyday lives, we must surmount one obstacle...</p>

                <p>That obstacle is making <em>₸hanks</em> part of our every day life.</p>

                <p>The great news is that <em>₸hanks</em> <strong>are</strong> already part of our lives. Everyday we thank friends and strangers, and get thanks in return.
                  If thanks were money, we would all be rich!</p>

                <p>With <em>Plenty</em>, <em>₸hanks</em> <strong>are</strong> money! Better yet, they exist in their natural habitat &mdash; a conversation.</p>

                <p>We chose to integrate a chat app and <em>₸hanks</em> because chats are ubiquitous. They are one of the most used applications on daily basis.
                  Together they make a beautiful match!</p>

                  <p> To us it is more important than ever to transform our vision into a tangible reality; <strong>we have a little human on the

              <p><em>In a nutshell, the following is the problem with the dollar. To understand it, you need some
                proficiency with mathematics and finance.</em></p>

              <p>What if I gave you $10 every year for <em>Infinity</em>? How many dollars would you eventually have? Duh &mdash; <em>Infinite</em> amount.</p>

              <p>Feel rich yet? Let us burst your bubble.<br/>
                What is your <em>Infinity</em> of dollars worth? Just a mere $510.</p>

              <p class="equation">How? <em>Inflation</em>.<br/>
                <img src="etc/inflation.png" alt="equation" /></p>

              <p>The above is a geometric series sum, adding $10 from 0 until <em>Infinity</em> at 2% inflation rate (the current rate in
                Canada and US). Which is the same as: $10 + $9.80 + &hellip; + $8.20 + &hellip; + 0.01 + &hellip;</p>

              <p>Is this not insane to you? How can an <em>Infinite</em> amount of dollars equal a meager $510? <br/>
                How do you expect a corporation to preserve the Amazon? Yes, the Amazon is of <em>Infinite</em> worth, but because of inflation, financially it&rsquo;s not.</p>

              <p>Natural currencies flip the equation.<br/>
                They make it profitable to keep the Amazon alive.</p>
