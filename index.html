                <h2>Hacking money to feed kids</h2>
                <p>We aren’t into changing the world. That’s too big a task, we’re too small a group.
                  We work smart. We are <em>nudging</em> the world, and this will bring changes larger than we could have ever imagined.</p>

                <p>We’ve been thinking about this a very long time. It’s doable. The recipe is actually simple.
                  It has been done before. It worked.</p>

                <p>Take a pause here. Let us ask you a question: just how many global issues bother you? How many of them are based in some real, physical limitation?</p>

                <p>We can think of a very long list, to name a couple:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Starving kids, even in “1st” world countries (the world produces more than enough food to feed everybody) and abject poverty (how is that still a thing?)</li>
                  <li>Cutting down the Amazon (we’ll all suffocate) and overfishing to the point of complete depletion</li>
                </ul>


                <p>We call these issues moronic, because unlike death and disease, there’s nothing stopping the human race from raising
                  above.</p>

                <h2>Natural money as crypto-currency</h2>
                <p>Many people have an impression that CEOs of multinational corporations are inherently <em>&ldquo;evil&rdquo;</em>. That&rsquo;s not the truth.</p>

                <p>CEOs are simply playing by the rules, laws, regulations and fundamentally mechanical properties of money. It&rsquo;s a
                  large scale game of Monopoly. You don&rsquo;t think your friends are evil, when you play Monopoly and they ask you for
                  rent? No, they&rsquo;re just playing by the rules.</p>

                <p>Money is absolutely <em>fundamental to civilization</em>, but it is also totally <em>malleable</em> &mdash; after all it is an abstract
                  concept, born of human mind. It&rsquo;s not a law of nature. We can change how money works.</p>

                <p><em>Natural currencies</em> are the answer to preventing human race from self-destructing. The technical term is demurrage,
                  and it simply means that the longer you hold money, the less you have &mdash; negative interest. It&rsquo;s the same as going
                  grocery shopping; you buy what you need, and not for 3 months ahead, because food spoils.</p>

                <p>We aren&rsquo;t inventing this concept. The ancient Egyptians used this system of money with clay tablets &mdash; this is
                  ancient stuff, well forgotten! A modern example, is a little town of Wörgl in Austria, that was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%C3%B6rgl#The_W%C3%B6rgl_Experiment">booming during the
                    Great Depression</a>. Wait, what, <strong>booming during the Great Depression</strong>? Yes, in desperation they introduced a local
                  natural currency, and a little town of 4000 people built a reservoir, a ski jump, and a bridge. The national bank
                  shut the experiment down.</p>

                <p>Negative interest rate is nothing to be afraid of. Remember, your savings are already being drained by inflation. The
                  difference is in the math, and how it <a href="#for-curious">affects financial calculations</a> &mdash; precisely the thing that <em>&ldquo;Big Evil
                    Corporations&rdquo;</em> do. By changing the mechanics of money &mdash; flipping the rules of the game &mdash; we make it profitable to keep the
                  Amazon alive, we transform &ldquo;the root of all evil&rdquo; into the root of all good.</p>

                <p>That is why we created a crypto-currency based on these principles. It&rsquo;s a one of a kind in the crypto-currency
                  world, because <strong>you can&rsquo;t buy it</strong>. We&rsquo;re not interested in making a bunch of dollars from a token sale like the rest
                  . We&rsquo;re envisioning a world beyond the dollar, and will do anything in our power to manifest it.</p>

                <h2>The app</h2><p>There&rsquo;s another thing that makes us a unique project. We are building a <em>self-governance</em> and <em>self-organization</em>
                application on top of our currency, which immediately makes it useful!</p>

                <p>Can you think of a better match: a crypto-currency meant to build <em>strong local communities</em>, with a tool making it
                  possible for <em>large groups of people to organize</em> into efficient micro-governments?</p>

                <p>The app is meant for organizing a group of people at any level, from a book club to a country; the one key ingredient
                  is that you have to meet on regular basis.</p>

                    <p>Our vision is a drastically different world. We see a peaceful, green and blue planet, but we are afraid that without
                      adopting a sane form of money, globally, humans will turn it into an uninhabitable dust ball.</p>

                    <p> To us it is more important than ever to transform our vision into a tangible reality; <strong>we have a little human on the

                    <p> We are working harder than ever. All we need to continue the good fight is a bit of support, just some food on

              <p><em>In a nutshell, the following is the problem with the dollar. To understand it, you need some
                proficiency with mathematics and finance.</em></p>

              <p>What if I gave you $10 every year for <em>Infinity</em>? How many dollars would you eventually have? Duh &mdash; <em>Infinite</em> amount.</p>

              <p>Feel rich yet? Let us burst your bubble.<br/>
                What is your <em>Infinity</em> of dollars worth? Just a mere $510.</p>

              <p class="equation">How? <em>Inflation</em>.<br/>
                <img src="etc/inflation.png" alt="equation" /></p>

              <p>The above is a geometric series sum, adding $10 from 0 until <em>Infinity</em> at 2% inflation rate (the current rate in
                Canada and US). Which is the same as: $10 + $9.80 + &hellip; + $8.20 + &hellip; + 0.01 + &hellip;</p>

              <p>Is this not insane to you? How can an <em>Infinite</em> amount of dollars equal a meager $510? <br/>
                How do you expect a corporation to preserve the Amazon? Yes, the Amazon is of <em>Infinite</em> worth, but because of inflation, financially it&rsquo;s not.</p>

              <p>Natural currencies flip the equation.<br/>
                They make it profitable to keep the Amazon alive.</p>
